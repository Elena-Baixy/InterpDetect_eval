  },
  "Rationale": {
    "DE1_ResultFidelity": "Replicated results match original within ~1.5% tolerance. SVC validation F1 differs by -0.60%, self-evaluation F1 by -1.26%, and proxy-based F1 by +1.42%. These small differences are attributable to different random splits during replication. When using the repository's pre-trained SVC model, exact matches (74.68% self-eval, 75.36% proxy-based) are achieved. All correlation trends (negative ECS, positive PKS in later layers) match the original.",
    "DE2_ConclusionConsistency": "All major conclusions are consistent: (1) ECS negative correlation with hallucination confirmed, (2) PKS positive correlation in later layers confirmed, (3) SVC identified as best classifier with XGBoost overfitting noted, (4) generalization from small proxy model to larger models validated, (5) effectiveness compared to baselines maintained. No contradictions or omitted essential claims.",
    "DE3_NoExternalInformation": "No external references, invented findings, or hallucinated details introduced. All claims trace to plan.md, CodeWalkthrough.md, or source code (e.g., BGE-base-en-v1.5 found in scripts/compute_scores.py). Technical details like specific correlation values represent legitimate replication outputs from running the provided code."
