  "Checklist": {
    "DE1_ResultFidelity": "PASS",
    "DE2_ConclusionConsistency": "PASS",
    "DE3_NoExternalInformation": "PASS"
  },
  "Rationale": {
    "DE1_ResultFidelity": "Replicated results match original within acceptable tolerance. Span-level validation F1 scores differ by less than 1.2%. Response-level F1 scores differ by less than 1.5%. Key patterns (SVC best performance, XGBoost overfitting, proxy generalization) are preserved.",
    "DE2_ConclusionConsistency": "All key conclusions are consistent: SVC best validation performance, XGBoost overfitting, proxy model generalization to GPT-4.1-mini, and practical applicability of small proxy models for hallucination detection. No contradictions or omissions of essential claims.",
    "DE3_NoExternalInformation": "All information in the replicated documentation is traceable to the original documentation or actual replication experiment results. No external references, invented findings, or hallucinated details were introduced. Data counts, feature definitions, and methodology descriptions match the original."
