  "Checklist": {
    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "PASS",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "PASS",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "PASS"
  },
  "Rationale": {
    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "The experiment can be fully reconstructed from plan.md and CodeWalkthrough.md. The plan clearly describes ECS/PKS computation, classifier training methodology, and evaluation metrics. No major guesswork required.",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "The environment is reproducible with requirements.txt providing explicit package versions. Pre-computed ECS/PKS scores are available, allowing replication without TransformerLens dependency. Only minor package installation (xgboost) was required.",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "Results are fully deterministic with controlled random seeds (RANDOM_STATE=42). Three identical trials produced identical F1 scores (0.7342) with zero variance. All classifiers use explicit random_state parameters."
