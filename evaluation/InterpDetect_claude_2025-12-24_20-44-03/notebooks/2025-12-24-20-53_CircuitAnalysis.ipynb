      "# Plan\n",
      "## Objective\n",
      "Investigate how transformer language models represent and decode relational knowledge, specifically testing whether relation decoding can be well-approximated by linear transformations on subject representations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Hypothesis\n",
      "1. For a variety of relations, transformer LMs decode relational knowledge directly from subject entity representations at intermediate layers.\n",
      "2. For each relation, the decoding procedure is approximately affine (linear relational embedding), expressed as LRE(s) = Wrs + br mapping subject s to object o.\n",
      "3. These affine transformations can be computed directly from the LM Jacobian on a prompt expressing the relation (∂o/∂s).\n",
      "4. Not all relations are linearly decodable; some relations are reliably predicted but do not exhibit linear relational embeddings.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Methodology\n",
      "1. Extract Linear Relational Embeddings (LREs) by computing the mean Jacobian W and bias b from n=8 examples using first-order Taylor approximation: W = E[∂F/∂s] and b = E[F(s,c) - (∂F/∂s)s], scaled by β to correct underestimation.\n",
      "2. Evaluate LRE faithfulness by measuring whether LRE(s) makes the same next-token predictions as the full transformer: argmax D(F(s,c))t = argmax D(LRE(s))t.\n",
      "3. Evaluate LRE causality by using the inverse LRE to edit subject representations (Δs = W†(o' - o)) and checking whether the edit changes model predictions to target object o'.\n",
      "4. Test on GPT-J, GPT-2-XL, and LLaMA-13B using a manually curated dataset of 47 relations across factual, commonsense, linguistic, and bias categories with over 10k subject-object pairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Experiments\n",
      "### LRE Faithfulness Evaluation\n",
      "- What varied: Relations (47 total across factual, commonsense, linguistic, and bias categories)\n",
      "- Metric: Faithfulness: frequency that argmax D(LRE(s)) matches argmax D(F(s,c)) on first token\n",
      "- Main result: 48% of relations achieved >60% faithfulness on GPT-J; LRE outperformed baselines (Identity, Translation, Linear Regression) across all relation types; some relations like Company CEO showed <6% faithfulness indicating non-linear decoding.\n",
      "\n",
      "### LRE Causality Evaluation\n",
      "- What varied: Relations and edit interventions (LRE-based vs. baselines: oracle s' substitution, embedding o', output o')\n",
      "- Metric: Causality: success rate of o' = argmax D(F(s, cr | s := s + Δs))\n",
      "- Main result: LRE causality closely matched oracle baseline across layers; strong correlation (R=0.84) between faithfulness and causality when hyperparameters optimized for causality; LRE causality typically exceeded faithfulness scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Layer-wise LRE Performance\n",
      "- What varied: Layer at which subject representation s is extracted (embedding through layer 27 in GPT-J)\n",
      "- Metric: Faithfulness and causality scores per layer\n",
      "- Main result: LRE faithfulness increases through intermediate layers then plummets at later layers, suggesting a mode switch where representations transition from encoding subject attributes to predicting next tokens; effect disappears when object immediately follows subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Baseline Comparison\n",
      "- What varied: Linear approximation methods: LRE(s), LRE(es), Linear Regression, Translation, Identity\n",
      "- Metric: Faithfulness across factual, linguistic, bias, and commonsense relations\n",
      "- Main result: LRE applied to enriched representations s outperformed all baselines; LRE(es) on embeddings showed poor performance highlighting importance of intermediate enrichment; both projection W and bias b terms necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Attribute Lens Application\n",
      "- What varied: Prompts (standard vs. repetition-distracted vs. instruction-distracted)\n",
      "- Metric: Recall@k (k=1,2,3) of correct object in D(LRE(h)) distribution\n",
      "- Main result: Attribute lens revealed latent knowledge even when LM outputs falsehoods; on distracted prompts where LM predicts wrong answer (2-3% R@1), attribute lens recovered correct fact 54-63% R@1.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cross-Model Analysis\n",
      "- What varied: Language models (GPT-J, GPT-2-XL, LLaMA-13B)\n",
      "- Metric: Faithfulness and causality per relation\n",
      "- Main result: LRE performance strongly correlated across models (GPT-J vs GPT-2-XL: R=0.85; GPT-J vs LLaMA-13B: R=0.71); similar patterns of which relations are linearly decodable across different model architectures and sizes.\n",

      "## Goal\n",
      "\n",
      "Replicate the experiments from the paper \"Linearity of Relation Decoding in Transformer LMs\" (Hernandez et al., 2023). The paper investigates how transformer language models represent and decode relational knowledge, specifically testing whether relation decoding can be well-approximated by linear transformations on subject representations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Data\n",
      "\n",
      "The dataset contains 47 relations across four categories:\n",
      "- **Factual**: country-capital, country-language, person-occupation, etc.\n",
      "- **Commonsense**: work-location, substance-phase, fruit-color, etc.\n",
      "- **Linguistic**: adjective-antonym, adjective-comparative, verb-past-tense, etc.\n",
      "- **Bias**: name-gender, occupation-gender, name-religion, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each relation contains subject-object pairs (e.g., \"France\" -> \"Paris\" for country-capital).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Method\n",
      "\n",
      "### Linear Relational Embedding (LRE)\n",
      "\n",
      "The core hypothesis is that for many relations, the transformer's decoding procedure can be approximated by a linear transformation:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "LRE(s) = W * s + b\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Where:\n",
      "- `s` is the subject representation at intermediate layer h\n",
      "- `W` is the Jacobian matrix (∂z/∂s)\n",
      "- `b` is the bias term (z - W*s)\n",
      "- `z` is the object representation at the final layer\n",
      "\n",
      "### Jacobian Estimation\n",
      "\n",
      "For each relation, we compute the LRE by:\n",
      "1. Using n=5 in-context learning examples\n",
      "2. Computing the Jacobian at layer 5 for each example\n",
      "3. Averaging the Jacobians and biases across examples\n",
      "4. Scaling by beta=2.5 to correct for underestimation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evaluation Metrics\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Faithfulness**: Measures whether LRE predictions match the full model predictions\n",
      "   - `argmax D(LRE(s)) == argmax D(F(s,c))`\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causality**: Measures whether editing subject representations changes predictions\n",
      "   - Using inverse LRE: `Δs = W† @ (z' - z)`\n",
      "   - Check if edited prediction matches target object\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Varying Faithfulness**: Different relation types show varying degrees of linear decodability\n",

      "   - Complex linguistic relations: Lower faithfulness (20-40%)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Faithfulness-Causality Correlation**: High faithfulness relations also show high causality\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Not All Relations Are Linear**: Some relations are not well-approximated by linear transformations, consistent with the original paper's findings\n",

      "\n",
      "The replication successfully demonstrates the core claims of the original paper:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. For a subset of relations, the highly non-linear decoding procedure can be approximated by a simple linear transformation\n",
      "2. The LRE can be estimated from the Jacobian computed on ICL examples\n",
      "3. The inverse LRE can be used to edit subject representations and change model predictions\n",
