        "CS2_Plan_vs_Implementation": "PASS"
    },
    "Rationale": {
        "CS1_Results_vs_Conclusion": "All evaluable conclusions match the originally recorded results: (1) All 448 ECS attention head features show negative correlation with hallucination (mean = -0.226), (2) Late FFN layers (20-27) show higher positive PKS correlation (0.238) than early layers (0.053), (3) Self-evaluation F1 = 74.68% matches exactly using pre-trained SVC model, (4) Proxy-based F1 = 75.36% matches exactly using pre-trained SVC model on GPT-4.1-mini test set.",
        "CS2_Plan_vs_Implementation": "All 5 methodology steps from the plan are implemented: (1) ECS computation via attention weights and BGE embeddings in compute_scores.py, (2) PKS computation via Jensen-Shannon divergence on vocabulary distributions using residual stream before/after FFN, (3) TransformerLens on Qwen3-0.6b with 28 layers and 16 attention heads verified in data, (4) All 4 classifiers (LR, SVC, RF, XGBoost) trained with StandardScaler and saved as pickle files, (5) Both self-evaluation (Qwen) and proxy-based evaluation (GPT-4.1-mini) completed with dedicated test datasets."
