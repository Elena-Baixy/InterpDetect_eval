    "Checklist": {
        "CS1_Results_vs_Conclusion": "FAIL",
        "CS2_Plan_vs_Implementation": "PASS"
    },
    "Rationale": {
        "CS1_Results_vs_Conclusion": "FAIL because the claim 'SVC achieved highest validation F1 (76.60%)' does not match the actual results. While 4 out of 5 conclusions match (ECS negative correlations verified, PKS later-layer correlation verified, Self-Evaluation F1=74.68% verified, Proxy-Based F1=75.36% verified), the classifier selection claim is contradicted by the data: XGBoost achieves 95.36% validation F1, which is higher than SVC's 78.89%. The claim states SVC had the highest validation F1, but XGBoost outperforms it significantly.",
        "CS2_Plan_vs_Implementation": "PASS because all 5 methodology steps from the plan are fully implemented: (1) ECS computation using attention weights and cosine similarity is in compute_scores.py, (2) PKS computation using Jensen-Shannon divergence via KL divergence is in compute_scores.py, (3) TransformerLens with Qwen3-0.6b model extracting signals across 28 layers and 16 heads is implemented, (4) All 4 classifiers (LR, SVC, RandomForest, XGBoost) with StandardScaler are in classifier.py, (5) Both self-evaluation and proxy-based evaluation are supported with test data for Qwen and GPT-4.1-mini responses."
