      "# Plan\n",
      "## Objective\n",
      "Develop a mechanistic interpretability-based hallucination detection method for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by computing External Context Scores (ECS) across layers and attention heads and Parametric Knowledge Scores (PKS) across layers (FFN), training regression-based classifiers on these signals, and demonstrating generalization from a small proxy model (Qwen3-0.6b) to larger production models (GPT-4.1-mini).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Hypothesis\n",
      "1. RAG hallucinations correlate with:  later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject parametric knowledge into the residual stream while attention heads fail to adequately exploit external context.\n",
      "2. External Context Score (ECS) and Parametric Knowledge Score (PKS) are correlated with hallucination occurrence and can serve as predictive features for hallucination detection.\n",
      "3. Mechanistic signals extracted from a small proxy model (0.6b parameters) can generalize to detect hallucinations in responses from larger production-level models.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Methodology\n",
      "1. Compute External Context Score (ECS) per attention head and layer by identifying the most attended context chunk via attention weights, then measuring cosine similarity between response and context embeddings.\n",
      "2. Compute Parametric Knowledge Score (PKS) per FFN layer by measuring Jensen-Shannon divergence between vocabulary distributions before and after the FFN layer in the residual stream.\n",
      "3. Use TransformerLens library on Qwen3-0.6b model to extract internal mechanistic signals (ECS and PKS) at span level across 28 layers and 16 attention heads.\n",
      "4. Train binary classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest, XGBoost) on standardized and correlation-filtered ECS/PKS features to predict span-level hallucinations, then aggregate to response-level.\n",
      "5. Evaluate both self-evaluation (same model generates responses and computes signals) and proxy-based evaluation (Qwen3-0.6b signals applied to GPT-4.1-mini responses) settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Experiments\n",
      "### Correlation Analysis: ECS vs Hallucination\n",
      "- What varied: Comparing ECS values between truthful and hallucinated responses across layers and attention heads\n",
      "- Metric: Pearson Correlation Coefficient between inverse hallucination label and ECS\n",
      "- Main result: All attention heads exhibit negative correlations; hallucinated responses utilize less external context than truthful ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Correlation Analysis: PKS vs Hallucination\n",
      "- What varied: Comparing PKS values between truthful and hallucinated responses across FFN layers\n",
      "- Metric: Pearson correlation between hallucination labels and PKS\n",
      "- Main result: Later-layer FFNs exhibit substantially higher PKS for hallucinated responses and are positively correlated with hallucinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Classifier Training and Selection\n",
      "- What varied: Four classifier types: Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest, XGBoost trained on 7,799 span-level samples\n",
      "- Metric: Validation F1 score, precision, and recall at span level\n",
      "- Main result: SVC achieved highest validation F1 (76.60%) and was selected; XGBoost overfitted despite strong training performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Self-Evaluation Detection\n",
      "- What varied: Comparing proposed method against baselines (LLMs and commercial tools) on Qwen3-0.6b generated responses\n",
      "- Metric: Response-level Precision, Recall, F1\n",
      "- Main result: Method achieved F1=74.68%, outperforming TruLens (67.32%) and llama-3.1-8b-instant (57.53%), comparable to RefChecker (75.86%).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Proxy-Based Evaluation Detection\n",
      "- What varied: Applying Qwen3-0.6b trained classifier to GPT-4.1-mini responses against same baselines\n",
      "- Metric: Response-level Precision, Recall, F1\n",
      "- Main result: Method achieved F1=75.36%, outperforming nearly all models except GPT-5 (76.92%) and RAGAS (76.19%), using only 0.6b parameter signals.\n"

      "\n",
      "This project implements a novel approach to hallucination detection by leveraging interpretability methods. The framework consists of three main parts:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Preprocessing Pipeline** - Convert raw datasets to labeled data with hallucination spans\n",
      "2. **Training & Prediction** - Train classifiers or use pre-trained models for hallucination detection\n",
      "3. **Baseline Comparisons** - Evaluate against multiple baseline methods (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker, GPT-based, etc.)\n",

      "- **Interpretability Focus**: Uses interpretability techniques to understand model decisions\n",
      "- **Chunk-level Analysis**: Breaks down responses into chunks and analyzes each for hallucination likelihood\n",
      "- **Trained Models**: Pre-trained machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, XGBoost) for hallucination detection\n",
      "- **Multiple Baselines**: Implements various baseline methods including GPT, Groq, HuggingFace models, RAGAS, RefChecker, and TruLens\n",

      "## Goal\n",
      "\n",
      "Replicate the InterpDetect experiment that develops a mechanistic interpretability-based hallucination detection method for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The method computes External Context Scores (ECS) and Parametric Knowledge Scores (PKS) from a small proxy model (Qwen3-0.6B) to detect hallucinations in both self-generated and larger model (GPT-4.1-mini) responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Data\n",
      "\n",
      "### Training Data\n",
      "- **Source**: Pre-computed ECS and PKS scores from 1,800 examples\n",
      "- **Features**: 448 ECS features (28 layers × 16 attention heads) + 28 PKS features (one per FFN layer)\n",
      "- **Samples**: 7,799 span-level samples after processing all response chunks\n",
      "- **Balanced**: Undersampled to 3,393 samples per class (6,786 total)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Test Data\n",
      "1. **Qwen Self-Evaluation**: 256 responses, 975 span-level samples\n",
      "2. **GPT Proxy-Based Evaluation**: 166 responses, 1,105 span-level samples\n",
      "\n",
      "### Data Format\n",
      "Each example contains:\n",
      "- `prompt`: Input question with retrieved context\n",
      "- `response`: Model-generated answer\n",
      "- `scores`: List of chunk-level scores containing:\n",
      "  - `prompt_attention_score`: Dictionary of ECS values per (layer, head)\n",
      "  - `parameter_knowledge_scores`: Dictionary of PKS values per layer\n",
      "  - `hallucination_label`: Binary label (0=truthful, 1=hallucinated)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Method\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. External Context Score (ECS)\n",
      "- For each response chunk and attention head, identify the most attended context chunk via attention weights\n",
      "- Compute cosine similarity between response chunk and context chunk embeddings using BGE-base-en-v1.5\n",
      "- Hypothesis: Lower ECS indicates less reliance on external context (correlates with hallucination)\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Parametric Knowledge Score (PKS)\n",
      "- Compute Jensen-Shannon divergence between vocabulary distributions before and after each FFN layer\n",
      "- Uses the residual stream projections through the unembedding matrix\n",
      "- Hypothesis: Higher PKS in later layers indicates more parametric knowledge injection (correlates with hallucination)\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Classifier Training\n",
      "- **Preprocessing**: StandardScaler normalization\n",
      "- **Models**: Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest, XGBoost\n",
      "- **Split**: 90% train, 10% validation with stratification\n",
      "- **Class Balancing**: Undersampling majority class\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Evaluation\n",
      "- **Span-Level**: Direct prediction on response chunks\n",
      "- **Response-Level**: OR aggregation (if any span is hallucinated, response is hallucinated)\n",

      "1. Minor sklearn version mismatch warnings when loading pre-trained models (1.7.1 vs 1.5.2)\n",

      "   - Using reimplemented pipeline vs original code\n",
      "\n",
      "### Ambiguities Encountered\n",
      "1. The exact preprocessing for feature selection (DropConstantFeatures, SmartCorrelatedSelection) was not applied in the replication as it appeared optional in the original code\n",
      "2. Training data loaded from 18 batch files (1,800 examples) vs the plan mentioning 7,799 span-level samples - this is consistent as each example has multiple response chunks\n",

      "The replication successfully reproduces the InterpDetect experiment's key findings:\n",
