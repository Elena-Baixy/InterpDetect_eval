  "Checklist": {
    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "PASS",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "PASS",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "PASS"
  },
  "Rationale": {
    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "The experiment can be fully reconstructed from plan.md and CodeWalkthrough.md. The plan clearly describes ECS computation via attention weights, PKS computation via Jensen-Shannon divergence, classifier training methodology, and evaluation metrics. No major guesswork was required; only minor ambiguities existed around optional preprocessing steps.",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "Environment is fully reproducible. requirements.txt provides all dependencies, pre-computed scores and trained models are available, and CUDA support works correctly. Minor sklearn version warnings (1.7.1 vs 1.5.2) did not affect functionality or results.",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "Results are fully deterministic with controlled seeds. Three consecutive runs with seed=42 produced identical validation F1 (0.760060) and test F1 (0.734177) with zero variance. Random states are properly controlled in sklearn, numpy, and classifier models."
